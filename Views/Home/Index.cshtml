        <p>2Thor is a private teacher platform where students from the University of Agder 
            can become tutors and teach other students. No matter if students need help 
            understanding the course content or help with a project, we are sure there is a 
            tutor that can offer help to you at 2Thor. As a student you can search for 
            the course you have problems with, choose a tutor, get contact and meet your 
            tutor at the university to get help. 
        If you feel like you can help other people, perfect. Register as a tutor, 
        help students and make some extra money.
        2Thor has the advantage that students teach students. A peer tutor can 
        concentrate more on the studentsâ€™ level of knowledge than a teacher sometimes can. 
        Besides learning and tutoring 2Thor is also great option to get to know other 
        students at UiA.</p>

        <div class="box2"><p3>Safety instructions</p3>
        <p>For security reasons we recommend our tutors and students to meet at the university. 
        You can book one of the group rooms, use the library or one of the tables in the public area. 
        Also note that just students and employees of the university can access 2Thor with their university 
        mail. That makes the platform more secure and transparent. The University of Agder is not liable 
        for anything that is related to 2Thor.</p>
        <p4>2Thor is a platform where students teach other students.</p4>
       <p3>Payment</p3>
        <p>2Thor is a platform where students teach other students. Please keep that 
            in mind when you define your hourly wage. We suggest a wage between a cup 
            of coffee and 200kr per hour to make it an affordable and good experience for 
            students and tutors.</p>

            <p>You are really good in one or more of your courses and like to help others? 
                Then 2Thor is the perfect platform for you. Here you can show off your knowledge, 
                help other students, socialise and earn a few Kroners on the side. To become a tutor, 
                you have to register and accept our rules and regulations. It is important to create a 
                completed profile with your strength and your offers so that interested students can find 
                you as a tutor and get in touch with you. The higher amount of hammers you get
                in your reviews, the higher in the list of tutors you will be in the courses you teach.
